	<p> The way that the Fallout 4 campaing starts is your a man in is bathroom standing in front if his mirror and his wife Nora walks in and tells you that you can't ba late for the speech. This is where you are able to custumize your character you can be man or woman. Now when you are done custumizing your character you walk into your kitchen and you see your robotic buttler Codsworth and he tells that your coffe is done, you can either drink it or you can just walk away from the coffe. After a minute or two your baby, Shaun starts crying and Codsworth goes to his room to make him stop crying. By then your door bell rings and your wife or husband asks you to get that. Once you open the door you and you see the vault representative.
